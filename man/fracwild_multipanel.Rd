\usage{
fracwild_multipanel(
  esu,
  pops,
  fracwild.fit,
  min.year = NULL,
  max.year = NULL,
  show.all = TRUE,
  nwctrends.options = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{esu}{The name of the ESU}

\item{pops}{The population names that will be plotted (populations with too few data are eliminated)}

\item{fracwild.fit}{fracwild fit returned by \code{trend_fits()}}

\item{min.year}{The x axis minimum.}

\item{max.year}{The x axis maximum.}

\item{show.all}{If there is no fracwild data for a population, should that population still have a fracwild plot, which will be blank.}

\item{nwctrends.options}{A list of plot options to change the appearance (colors, line types, line widths, point types, etc)
in the plots. See \code{\link{nwctrends.options}} for a description of the options. Note, if \code{risk_plot_multipanel()} is
called from \code{\link{NWCTrends_report}()} then \code{nwctrends.options} has already been set and can be left at \code{NULL} in this call.}
}
\value{
A plot
}
\description{
This is the fracwild figure function. Not exported. It is used by \code{\link{NWCTrends_report}} and \code{inst/doc/report_files/esu_report.Rmd}.

The dots are the raw fracwild values, the black
line is the smoothed fracwild estimate.
For the smoothed fracwild estimates, there is no data sharing across populations.

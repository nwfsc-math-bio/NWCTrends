# NWCTrends

# Version 1.26

Added a data object `nwctrends.pallete` with red, blue, black, green and white defined (in a list). To change the colors, the user runs a line like
```
nwctrends.palette$red <- "yellow"
```
to say change red to yellow.

Added `show.all.fracwild` to `NWCTrends_report()` so that that can be changed from the main function.

# Version 1.25
This is the version used in the 2020 NWFSC PNW Salmonid Viability Report. 

Add more meta data: Method (Survey, Model), Citation, and Contributor. A `metadata.csv` file is added to each Output folder.

## Minor

* Added more info to `pkgname.R` Roxygen2 code.
* Added a `NEWS.md` file

# Version 1.0
This is the version used in the 2015 NWFSC PNW Salmonid Viability Report.

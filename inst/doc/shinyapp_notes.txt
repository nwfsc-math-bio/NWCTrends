  ## For shiny app ##
  # User will choose an input file
  # Choose fit.min.year and fit.max.year (based on min and max in data)
  # Choose plot.min.year and plot.max.year  (based on min and max in data)
  # min.data.points (a number between 2 and 10)
  # other arguments can be left at defaults for now
  
  ## Output
  # The user will want to be able to download the files produced for each ESU
  # There are 9 produced.  See inst/doc/figures/ESU_figures
  # where I have left in results from running one ESU.
  # inst/doc/figures/ESU_figures
  #
  # But we will also want to show the output in tabs.  Since the user might want
  # to run multiple ESUs, I'm not sure how best to do this.
  # Run this NWCTrends_report(output.type="html")
  # An html file will appear in inst/doc/figures/ESU_figures
  #  Look at that.  I could create a nicer version of that.
  #  Maybe a tab for each ESU and show that html file in each?
  #  Note, the .html file will use the .png files in inst/doc/figure in that case

# Local build and push to GitHub instructions

## Checking

Run check as normal.

## Updating man files

Make sure to configure the building so that man files are remade with Roxygen. Then install as normal.

## Creating the pkgdown

Make sure that the man files are rebuilt because pkgdown will not rebuild. Also sometimes garbage gets
build up in docs so you might delete that folder. pkgdown should rebuild it completely. 

Then run
```
pkgdown::build_site()
```

## Push to GitHub

The repo is set to deliver the Page with the docs folder.

# Local build and push to GitHub instructions

devtools R check commands will delete the inst/doc folder, but I want that properly constructed so that when the package is installed from GitHub, it has the vignettes. Note, it is actually the pkgbuild::build() that is removing the `inst/doc` folder I believe.

## Building

Install and Restart can be used as normal.

## Vignettes

The key is to have the `inst/doc` folder properly constructed with all the vignettes complete (with html, Rmd, and R) plus any extra PDFs that I want there.

Put the Rmd vignettes and any PDFs in the vignettes folder. Then run this code is `inst/doc` needs to be re-built (vignettes have changed).
```
tools::buildVignettes(dir = ".", tangle=TRUE)
dir.create("inst/doc")
file.copy(dir("vignettes", full.names=TRUE), "inst/doc", overwrite=TRUE)
```

This should still work
```
remotes::install_github(build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
It will warn that `inst/doc` will be deleted but I think I have the vignettes `.install_extras` set up so that the installed `inst/doc` will be the same as the `inst/doc` folder created by the above code.
